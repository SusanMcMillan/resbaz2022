:::{.callout-tip}
# YAML exercise
- Fill the `title: ` and `name: ` and `affiliation: ` fields.

- a couple of handy entries are already completed

- the existing field: `date: today` will automatically generate today's date.

- Render the document

- Give me a :heavy_check_mark: when done or a :hand: if you need help

## text editing

- Writing in Quarto uses [markdown syntax](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) 

- LaTeX is used to render PDFs so LaTeX commands can be used for PDF outputs

- Look! I can do fancy maths: $f_{c}=z^{2}+c$

:::{.callout-note}
# Pro tip!
Render regularly. Small errors can be tricky to pick out long after they have been made.

You can change the defult so that the document renders on hitting save.

How to do include inline equation: $\sqrt{4} = 2$


```{r}
6*7

```



# Packages and libraries {.unlisted}

It is good practice to include a list of packages used as well as any source files or functions up front. `{.unlisted}` will exclude the section from the table of contents. You can hide the section completely with `{.unlisted .hidden}`. This is useful for sections like 'packages' which are included in the code for reproducibility and are necessary to execute but maybe unnecessary to display. If your sections are numbered (insert `number-sections: true` in [YAML](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#section-numbering)) then you will need `{.unlisted. unnumbered .hidden}` to hide the section.

You might also include sourcing any function scripts (e.g., `source("my_functions.R")`).

```{r Libraries}
#| include: false
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman", repos="http://cran.r-project.org")
pacman::p_load(ggplot2, palmerpenguins)    # Install & load packages
```

# You can't see me! {.unlisted .hidden}

Lah lah lah!

I'm here in spirit, code will still be executed.

# Data wrangling

Typically you need to do some tidying of your data. Each project will have different reqirements e.g., transforming data or generating new datasets. You probably want to dedicate a section just for wrangling but may want to hide it from the output. See [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html) for more info.


# Visualisations {.tabset}

Sometimes I have a lot of plots (like, a lot!). Perhaps generated from a loop that outputs a list of related plots. It is possible to programatically generate panel tabsets rather that repeatedly writing out the heading `#` and inserting the plot (e.g., `plot_list[[1]]`). As an example, I've grabbed a couple of plots from [Alison Horst](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/examples.html) again.

```{r}
# A list of plots:
plot_list <- penguins |>
  split(penguins$species) |>
  lapply(function(x){
    ggplot(x, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) + 
      geom_point() +
      theme_minimal()
  }) 

# Make some heading names:
headings <- names(plot_list)
```

## Plot tabs

The code might be a little complicated but useful to reduce the length and manual work if you have a lot of outputs.

:::{.panel-tabset}
```{r, results='asis'}
#| warning: false

# Use a loop (or lapply, or map, you choose) to generate the headings and insert plots
for (i in seq_along(plot_list)) {
  cat("# ",headings[i],"\n")
  print(plot_list[[i]])
  cat('\n\n')
}
```

# To do

I sometimes keep a project to-do list here

- [x] Get up

- [ ] Present workshop

:::{.panel-tabset}
# Final remarks

This workshop is primarily designed to introduce you to tools and useful features in Quarto. Regardless of your workflow (which this template may not fit!), hopefully you will have the tools to make sharing results and colaborating with supervisors and researchers much easier.
